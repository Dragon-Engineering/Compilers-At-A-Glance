# Introduction to the modern compiler implementation in java

This is a condensed version for the the book "Modern compiler implementaion in java 2nd e by Andrew W. Appel - Cambridge-university-press".

Chapters implemented here by this repository:
- [x] [Lexical Analysis]()
- [ ] [Parsing]()
- [ ] [Abstract Syntax]()
- [ ] [Semantic Analysis]()
- [ ] [Activation Records]()
- [ ] [Translation into intermediate code]()
- [ ] [Basic blocks and traces]()
- [ ] [Instruction Selection]()
- [ ] [Liveness Analysis]()
- [ ] [Register Allocation]()

Compilers adopt a universal model, which modularizes code in `compiler modules` and `compiler inferfaces` aka. Compiler Phases:

![]()

Compiler phases: 
- [x] Lexing Phase: breaks down the source file into individual words or tokens.
- [ ] Parsing Phase: analyzes the phrase structure of a program.
- [ ] Semantic Actions: builds a piece of *abstract syntax tree* corresponding to each phrase.
- [ ] Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Frame Layout
- [ ] Translate
- [ ] Canonicalize
- [ ] Instruction Selection
- [ ] Control flow analysis 
- [ ] Data flow analysis
- [ ] Register Allocation
- [ ] Code Emission

Compiler modules:
